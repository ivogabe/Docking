The files in this directory were created by using the:
- protein data bank for obtaining the PDB files, which represent molecules
- PDB2PQR server to add radii and partial charges to the proteins and creating a different file format. 
- PRODRG server to add partial charges to small molecules. The pdb files of the small molecules were manually altered to create a similar file format to the PQR files. 
- wikipedia for adding the vanderwaals radii manually to the small molecule files
